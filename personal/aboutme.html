<font point-size=24pt color=#ff4444>100%</font>
<font color=#aaaaff point-size=14pt>made in Japan</font>
even I fail to meet their quality standard
<font color="#ffbb99">Ouch!(-_-)!</font>
But a good news was that a bad product in Japan was not necessary a bad product elsewhere in the world.  I was very luck that I happened to study at universities in U.S., where they are more ready to have students who actually want to study and explore.  Having libraries open for 24/7 is an good example, and I think it is totally awesome.<br>

Obviously, I love working in immersive environment or scientific visualization field.  When I was in high school, I watched an animated film, "Lensman".  The movie had several computer generated sequences.  I was shocked to see "another space I have never seen or entered" before.  Soon, I was creating my own 8 colors 3-D wire-frame graphics animation, by shooting computer monitor with 8mm FILM camera with a tripod.  I guess this is the beginning of my interests, which is still expanding.  Since earlier days of my study, I developed several thoughts about human computer interaction for large information, which later induced my interest to immersive environment and visualization techniques.  Through out my study and work, I always enjoyed to think how systems can possibly deal with human mind or physical ability.  This is why I like immersive environment and visualization.  No matter how well we could detect or filter our data, we still have to effectively present it to our mind and possibly interact with it.  I am looking at immersive environment, or virtual reality, as a possible effective vehicle and very much enjoying exploring in it.  Eventually, I am interesting in investigating immersive environment tools as aiding devices to our missing physical and non physical senses.<br>
