	In seismic processing and imaging, wave propagation modeling is often used to execute Reverse Time Migration, a way to transform data between time domain and depth domain in order to correctly localize subsurface structures.  The process is usually very expensive with traditional CPU-based systems.  By taking advantage of GPU's massive parallelism and fast internal memory structure, I achieved nearly 9x performance gain over Fortran-based code.  As many engineers know (strangely, this is often forgotten fact by computer scientists), Fortran is quite faster than C/C++.  GPU's memory size is still limited.  But if we can cascade memory transport between CPU and GPU (or for small enough data), the performance gain is just so amazing.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I am a software developer/consultant with background in computer sciences, art, and geophysics.  I specialize in scientific visualization, geophysical data processing, and processing large data.  I can not disclose details for my work at private corporations, but my work at University is open to public.  <br>

	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	  I can not disclose details on proprietary software unfortunately.  My task was improvement and stabilization of existing geophysical processing modules besides my main project.  Plugin Manager is a on-line processing module management tool I wrote for the newest release of SeisSpace.  This GUI tool allows users to find available processing modules on-line, fetch them, install them with security/integrity check, and keep track of the newest version of processing modules installed.<br>

	  While I worked as a Scientific Visualization Consultant/Specialist at TEXAS Advanced Computing Center (TACC), I had quite variety of tasks.  I have worked on system integration for a virtual reality system to support our facility.  I worked as the facility manager for a visualization lab.  I also spend a lot of my time for consulting researchers at University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas system, and on TegaGrid for their data analysis and visualization needs.  The level of consulting varies from just pointing a finger to software development for them.<br>

	  Again, I can not disclose details on proprietary software.  Besides my main projects, my daily task was improvement and stabilization of GUI-based operation console for Hitachi's MRI scanners.  My main projects were to develop modulated medical imaging systemto, and to build DICOM test environment and test data communications with other medical imaging scanner makers.<br>

      Before I pursue knowledge in computer science and geophysics, my specialty was in art/design, particularly photo and electronic imaging.  I started my training with traditional studio art, such as pencil drawing, 2-D design, 3-D design, and clay.  Since my goal was always to work in the field of computer graphics, I soon shifted my focus to electronic imaging for photo manipulation, 3-D rendering and interactive media.  As I enter to the field of computer science, I was hocked to the beauty of scientific/information visualization.  Even I do not particularly design something along my work, I do believe my background actually helps in the process of visualizing data.  Seismic processing and imaging is an extreme extension of scientific visualization.  Engineering we have now to process and image seismic data is extremely beautiful.<br>
