<P>Instantaneous visualization of the enstrophy distribution in a compressible, homogeneous isotropic turbulent field.  Enstrophy is an important property of a turbulent field, affecting how turbulence is dissipated.  We are interested in the effect of compressibility through shocks, which adds the effect of pressure and density gradient (so-called baroclinic torque), to the enstrophy distribution, straining the turbulent field.  We are also interested in a fundamental problem of the interaction between a detonation wave and a turbulent field, which is affected by chemistry.<br>
